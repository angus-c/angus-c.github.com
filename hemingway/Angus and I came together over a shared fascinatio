Angus and I came together over a shared fascination with the outside. The outside being art, literature, and any other gesture that ran counter to Silicon Valley.

Around 2012, this coalesced into ##ABC, an IRC book club which never actually read anything. Instead we were something like a support group, gathering there to make sense of our work, what we were doing, and how we were doing it, within the world, and through the lens of art and literature.

Some of these conversations later informed writings on http://byfat.xxx —posts like Divya Manian’s excellent “YES PlZ LETS BURNNNN” or my “rien ne tient en place.” But none were quite so well received as Angus’s “If Hemingway wrote Javascript.”

Angus had managed to perfectly articulate an issue central to many of us, our antipathy towards “the good parts”, and towards the general rhetoric of “the best way.” And he had done so by celebrating JavaScript's voice and variety, through exploration and experimentation. He was making the language ours, and it was precisely this ownership which served to liberate its potential for expression—its voice making our work not only bearable, but actually exciting. 

I wrote not long after that, “Like an artist painting a bowl of fruit, if I had to express each work the same way — with the only variety being in the fruits themselves — I’d surely have gone mad by now.” An insight on writing code, and my career at large, that I owe very much to my dear friend and his reflection on creativity and language as craft.

It’s been fun to watch this idea evolve from IRC, to the conference circuit, and now to book form — the medium which inspired this whole line of thought.
